You can only copy data from a song countdown list.

Copying albums will not work.

The first video, "copyPaste.mp4" will generate a playlist with the 10 selected songs.

When copying, hold the cursor just to the left of the first desired songs rank,
and drag the cursor just to the right of the last desired songs play count.

"extraCopyPaste.mp4" has additional examples of how you can copy songs.
The first example of copying will generate a playlist with the 8 selected songs

The second example of copying will generate a playlist with the top 50 songs.
If you'd like to generate a top 100 playlist, you can copy and paste the top 50 songs to the "copyPasteFromLastFM.txt",
then go to the next page on last.fm, copy and paste those 50 songs to the file too, save and continue from step 3.
